# Data-Logger
This project is made using c language programming. We make it using Dev-C++ 5.11 with the compiler TDM-GCC 4.9.2 64-bit Release and Arduino IDE. 
This project is used to store the data of temperature and humidity from the environment around of us in the micro SD using Arduino Uno R3 as the microcontroller. 
This project works by reading the data of temperature and humidity using the DHT11 as the sensor module. 
The data read by the sensor will be saved as text file and it will be stored in the micro SD card using micro SD module. 
Then, we use .c program to read the text file in the SD card and display it on the interface. 
Actually, we are also keep trying to use the RTC module (DS3231) to generate the real time of clock and date when the temperature and humidity data is showed on the interface.
This program is free to be used or developed by the others. If you have any question or suggestion, feel free to contact us.
